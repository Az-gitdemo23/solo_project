# Kubernetes (K8s)

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and start with the [project for this week](#metapod-project)

## Overview of the week

- There will be a session about Container Orchestration and another one about running K8s locally
- You'll work in teams to build your own K8s cluster using EKS on AWS (Your coach will announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll work on some K8s further challenges with your local clusters
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you explain and use common Container Orchestration practices with K8s along with listing its main benefits and problem it solves?**
* **Can you diagram the K8s cluster architecture and the different pieces that take part in it?**
* **Can you work as part of a team to build your own EKS cluster?**
* **Can you build your own K8s clusters locally using K3d?**
* **Do you have an understanding of the main differences between running your own K8s cluster locally as opposed to using a service to provision them from AWS?**

## Projects

This week is split into two projects.
Your coach will tell you as part of the kickoff which one you will be tackling first.

### Running Kubernetes locally

In this project, you will be working **in pairs** to run your own Kubernetes clusters locally using a tool called K3s.
You will be managing all components of a Kubernetes cluster, including the control plane, manually.

Your coach will either run or share with you a recording of the [Running Kubernetes locally workshop](/workshops/week-5/running_k8s_locally.md), which will introduce you to using K3s.

In pairs, you will then work on the [Kubernetes Further Challenges](k8s-further-challenges.md).

### Metapod

In this **team project**, you will be learning how to set up a Kubernetes cluster using AWS' Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). 

A K8s cluster can be difficult to build, configure and get started with, which means that for some companies, having to managing their own K8s clusters is not always desirable or cost-effective. 
So there are a bunch of solutions provided out there that fully manage the Kubernetes control plane.
EKS is one of them.

EKS is a managed service that simplifies running K8s clusters on AWS. You don't need to install or operate your own K8s control plane or worker nodes. 

> :warning: **Important:** This project is designed to be worked on as a team. Resource limitations on AWS mean that you will only be able to start one Kubernetes cluster per team! Make sure you work together on a single cluster.
