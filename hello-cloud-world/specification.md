# Hello Cloud World! specification

So by now you should have a working Express project that you should have tested in your local machine. Awesome!

:pencil2: Now, in your groups, diagram the desired flow:
- How are you planning to take your application to the cloud?

Remember that we are working with containers this week!

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB)
This is all great, but, where are we deploying our containerised application?

This week, our aim will be to deploy our application image to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which is a great service to deploy your first service on AWS.

By the end of the week, as a bonus, it would be great to have a fair understanding of the number of things AWS EB does for us under the hood! Do not worry if you do not understand all of them at this point, these are concepts that we will revisit in the future!
