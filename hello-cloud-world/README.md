# Hello Cloud World!

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss about the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and run through the [project setup](#project-setup)
4. You'll start reaching for the Cloud! Follow the 

## Overview of the week
- You'll work in teams to build and deploy your first containerised application to the Cloud! (I'll announce the teams on Slack.)
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be an optional session on Thursday to discuss Logging and Telemetry
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Goals for the week
You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you, with only a specification to guide you, work as part of a team to build and deploy a containerised web app?**

Finally, you should be also able to understand what the following concepts are and in which ways they are helpful for applications running on the cloud: `logging` and `telemetry`

### Project Setup
1. One member in your group, create a GitHub repo for your Hello Cloud World! project.
2. Add the other members of your group as collaborators.
3. Create a simple Node.js project on Express. The idea is for you to choose what you would like to render on the page and see on the web when your application is on the cloud. Choose something that you'd like to show to your friends!
