# Makers Academy - DevOps

Welcome to the first 6 weeks of the rest of your journey to become a DevOps expert...

Every week, either starting from the very beginning or scaffolding with existing material, we'll be building projects and deploying them to the Cloud, how exciting! Most projects will take one week.

At Makers Academy, we worked hard to figure out what needs to be learned in what order in order to maximise your productivity. The first weeks are designed to give you a foundation in Containers, Serverless and Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD), all of these being very important concepts in modern architectures. The goal is to understand how these work in order to deploy your great applications to the nominated Cloud providers and bring them live! Alongside these, we will be exploring different (equally important!) configuration and management concepts throughout the weeks.

By the end of this course, you should feel more comfortable in:
- Applying an understanding of modern architectures
- Applying best-practice DevOps techniques
- Applying an understanding of at least two out of the three main Cloud providers
- Applying a specialist understanding of a nominated Cloud provider
- Applying an understanding of connectivity and security issues
- Evangelising Cloud culture within a team!
