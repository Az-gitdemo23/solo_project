# Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS is a fully managed Container Orchestration Service. It is a very popular service on AWS.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how ECS and its different components work
- Launch first ECS sample app on AWS
- Introduction to Load Balancing

### Key Terminology
- Containers and Images
- Task Definition
- Task
- Cluster

### Practice: Launch Amazon ECS sample app

In your groups, using your existing knowledge about how ECS works and the different components that are part of it, you will launch the sample app given from Amazon.

Simply navigate to `Elastic Container Service` on the **AWS Console > Services** and work through the steps. Some important things to bear in mind in the process of doing so:
- Pay attention to the diagrams in the different sections of the process. Could you identify and understand the key concepts that appeared?
- Finally, what is the **Application Load Balancer** Amazon is asking you about in the `Service` step? Discuss in your groups what's the purpose of it.

### What's next?

Now you know how to launch the ECS service using one of the example apps Amazon displays on the AWS Console. That's a great starting point!

After getting familiar with the service, clusters and tasks, among others, you could:
- Build your own custom image and push that one to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Explore how you could deploy that image to ECS
