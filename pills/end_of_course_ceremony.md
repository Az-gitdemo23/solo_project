# End-of-course Ceremony

Here are some guidelines for your end-of-course presentations:

* The time limit is usually 5-8 minutes (this depends on the number of projects, your coach will advise if the time limit is different).  Practice, practice, practice to ensure you come in under the time limit. You'll be prompted to wind up your presentations after this time limit!

* If appropriate, make it funny. If not, make it engaging.

* To guide you on what to include, think about how far you've gone on your DevOps journey in just 6 weeks. What makes you most proud? Any *eureka* moments throughout your journey?

* How have you worked in teams in the different projects? What practices and rituals have been beneficial? Can you explain how these have helped you achieve a desired objective?

* Describe your learning journey from Week 1 until today. What did you start with. What did you learn and how? What were the lows and how did you overcome them. Focus on behaviours and skills. Be specific. Don't say, "we communicated well". Say, "We had a miscommunication where two pairs worked on the same feature. We decided in the future to..."

* No need to be overly technical. You can keep the detailed explanations for the project fair when people will come chat with you. The audience is mainly non-technical and they should be able to understand your description. Don't put up the _Wall of Death_ (the slide that is just library and framework logos).
