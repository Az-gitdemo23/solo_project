# Terraform and AWS

## Kick-off

1. We'll discuss about the important things for the week
2. We'll have a short Q&A
3. You'll get into your teams and run through the [project tasks](#project-setup-and-sections)

## Project overview

- You'll work in teams to set up two separate workflows: one to manage and deploy your infrastructure on AWS using Terraform and another one to deploy an existing application on AWS
- You'll organise your own work based on the goals for the week
- There will be a session about IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- There will be a retro on Friday

## Project goals

You are already familiar with these questions, but it's important to bear them in mind:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better DevOps engineer than you were yesterday?

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you explain what IaC (Infrastructure as code) is?**
* **Are you able to set an automatic workflow on GitHub Actions to manage your project infrastructure using Terraform?**
* **Can you set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your application on the existing infrastructure on AWS?**

### Project Setup and Sections

Initial Setup (All group members):
1. All members of the team: [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) on your machine using Homebrew.
2. Install the AWS CLI [using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscli). 

Make sure you complete the following sections in order:

#### Section 1: Terraform

1. One member in your group, create a **private** GitHub repository using a Terraform template for the **.gitignore** option. This repository will serve as the place from where you will manage your infrastructure for this week - Your Terraform project!
2. Add the other members of your group as collaborators.
4. Make a copy for your group of this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/MsYV9YsX/terraform-on-aws).
5. Work through the cards on the board and have fun!

#### Section 2: Task Listing App (on AWS)
